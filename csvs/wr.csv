Antonio Brown PIT (8),1,1.01,227.63,1.83,TIER 1,,TIER 1,"Back-to-back seasons as the no.1 WR. We discovered the only thing that can slow down Antonio Brown, and it was Michael Vick. Thankfully fantasy players don't need to worry about that anymore in the event Big Ben goes down, with Gradkowski coming back and Landry Jones proving he can at least move the offense. 2nd in the league in targets at 193, Brown feels as safe as a fantasy player possibly can."
Julio Jones ATL (11),2,1.03,225.6,2.67,TIER 1,,TIER 1,"JULIOOOOOO!! An absolute monster that carries only one concern, and that's his foot. Everything looked great last year. If fantasy owners had anything to complain about, it would be the fact Julio scored only two touchdowns in the final eight games. Look for Matt Ryan to continue to gain comfort in the new offensive system, and look for Julio to compete to finish as the no.1 WR in fantasy."
Odell Beckham Jr. NYG (8),3,1.03,220.23,2.33,TIER 1,,TIER 1,"The fears of Beckham being a one-year wonder were silenced after he gave his fantasy owners a scare in Week 1. Beckham is now the motor that moves the Giants offense and he hasn't come anywhere near his ceiling. Target monster, big plays, red zone efficiency, Beckham has everything you want in a fantasy WR. There's no reason to feel after back-to-back top-5 finishes (in his first two seasons) that Beckham should do anything less."
A.J. Green CIN (9),4,1.09,202.2,1.67,TIER 2,,TIER 2,"Green is a curious case because he felt like a disappointment, despite finishing as the WR8 and dropping nearly 1300 yards with 10 touchdowns. The disappointment is shown in the points total as Green was clearly a tier or two behind the top finishers. There has been shakeup in Cinci as they lost their run-heavy offensive coordinator, as well as the WR2 and WR3 in Jones and Sanu. It's very possible Green returns to the form of his second and third seasons as a target vacuum. Green does have the longest active streak of having at least 1000 receiving yards (five)."
Dez Bryant DAL (7),5,1.12,199.03,4.83,TIER 2,,TIER 2,"The dreams of Dez last season, destroyed by a Jones fracture. His foot has now seen multiple injuries in a short time. That's not to say he cannot come back, Julio Jones has been a beast after dealing with the same injury. The previous three seasons before 2015, Dez finished as a top-6 WR. He's nearly a lock for double-digit TDs if he plays a full season. Dez is unlikely to ever get the gaudy target volume of Julio or Brown, but his efficiency and TD scoring overcome that shortcoming."
Brandon Marshall NYJ (11),6,2.04,196.5,3.5,TIER 2,,TIER 2,"The Bears were done with Brandon Marshall, but Marshall wasn't done being one the league's premiere WRs. He finished as the WR3 last year in dominant fashion with 14 TDs, tying the league leaders. With Fitz and his magic beard back on board, look for Marshall to have a dominant fantasy season."
Allen Robinson JAC (5),7,2.02,189.07,4.57,TIER 2,,TIER 2,"The perfect storm occurred for Allen Robinson last year. Top level talent, a bad defense combined with a mistake-prone QB, and a nonexistent running game led to The Target Monster dropping a line of 80/1400/14. Unfortunately for fantasy owners, the Jags actually appear determined to not be the team they were last year. Similar to Hopkins, the fantasy draft price has been set by last year's success, and the more surprising outcome for this year would be a full repeat of success. Robinson is a stud, but we are more likely to see George Clooney and Marky Mark make a sequel to The Perfect Storm (**Spoiler Alert** They can't because Clooney dies in the movie)."
DeAndre Hopkins HOU (9),8,1.07,187.3,3.07,TIER 2,,TIER 2,"The talent level of Hopkins can't possibly be questioned at this point. But there was a very clear shift in the Texans team as a whole, halfway through the year. After the debacle against Miami, the Texans defense really turned around, so did the team's rushing yards. Despite losing Foster, the 2nd half of the year the team averaged 110.5 yards a game on the ground compared to 88. Game script turned around for them. Hopkins' numbers took a noticeable dip during this time, and now they throw in the unproven Brock Osweiler. All that said, Hopkins is certainly a WR1, but maybe more of a top-10 guy than a top-5."
Alshon Jeffery CHI (9),8,2.12,185.63,3.8,TIER 2,,TIER 2,"Big things were expected from Alshon last year. His soft muscle tissue chose not to fulfill these fantasy wishes. Despite playing only nine games and being hobbled in a lot of them, Jeffery had over 90 targets and over 800 yards. That had him on a pace for a career year. All while playing through injuries that even the most casual football fan would be able to notice. Alshon does have competition coming this year in the form of Kevin White. White hasn't played a single snap of professional football. Jeffery played full seasons the previous two years. Let the recency bias be someone else's problem, Jeffery is a beast."
Mike Evans TB (6),10,2.09,184.13,4.33,TIER 2,,TIER 2,"Evans had a solid year, but was a candidate ripe for TD regression and saw the narrative fulfilled to the extreme. He went from 12 TDs on 68 receptions, to only 3 TDs on 74 receptions. The good news for Evans is his QB Jameis Winston showed efficiency improvement over the course of the year. On top of getting better, Winston showed he had little concern to target his stud WR. In six of 15 games, Evans was targeted in the double-digits. Evans went from a regression candidate to a return to the mean candidate."
Sammy Watkins BUF (10),11,3.08,176.2,6.33,TIER 2,,TIER 2,"The beginning of the year was riddled with injuries and high variance performances from Sammy. Eventually, the ankle healed up, and the chemistry with Tyrod Taylor lit up. From Week 12 through Week 17 Watkins was the overall WR3, outperforming the likes of Antonio Brown, Allen Robinson, Julio Jones, and Odell Beckham. The red flag would be the extremely low volume with which he succeeded. He averaged under six catches a game in that dominant stretch. The talent is there, but Rex Ryan's scheme could prevent Sammy from consistent top level fantasy production."
Jordy Nelson GB (4),12,2.05,172.7,4.67,TIER 2,,TIER 2,"One of the most bizarre injuries of the offseason. Jordy looked like he slipped, runs off the field by himself, ends up having a torn ACL and missing the year. It was extremely disappointing with Jordy coming off a year with his second finish as the overall WR2. There is some slight concern in Jordy's age and recovery, but the Packers are clearly planning on Nelson returning to form. He had played complete seasons in three of the previous four years, and finished as a WR1 in each of them."
Demaryius Thomas DEN (11),13,3.08,168.77,4,TIER 3,,TIER 3,"Thomas had set such a high expectation from fantasy owners. Despite catching over 100 passes for over 1300 yards, he felt disappointing. Enter the power of the touchdown! Thomas went from from averaging 12 scores over the last three years, to only six. This production drop relegated him outside of the WR1 in standard scoring. The good news for Thomas, it can't get much worse than the quarterback play he received from Brock Osweiler and Pey-done Manning. The bad news, it appears Thomas should expect a lateral movement in QB play with 'Butt Fumble' Mark Sanchez or rookie Paxton Lynch throwing him the ball. Thomas is still a top talent, but expections should be along the lines of last year."
Brandin Cooks NO (5),14,3.03,166.03,4.63,TIER 3,,TIER 3,"Cooks appeared to be on a road trip to Bustsville through the first seven games of the year. In standard scoring, he was averaging just over seven points a game. Then the fantasy deathmatch of the Giants Vs. the Saints happened in Week 8. Through the final nine games, Cooks averaged over 13 points a game. Despite the strong second half, Cooks was not immune to 'crapping your team' with three weeks under four points each. Thankfully Cooks shouldn't cost a first or second round pick, moving him from a highly risky pick, to a solid value."
Amari Cooper OAK (10),15,2.11,165.5,3.37,TIER 3,,TIER 3,"Cooper had a sensational season by rookie standards. Only 20 rookies have had over 1000 yards in their first year, and Cooper's 1070 were good enough for the 10th best rookie season of all time. That production includes a leg injury that limited his production over the last quarter of the season, an injury that had the Raiders contemplating shutting him down. There's a few ways people feel about Cooper moving into his second year. Some fear the 'sophomore slump'. While others look at his production, while factoring in Michael Crabtree was often the first read and out-targeted Cooper 146 to 130. There's room for improvement here, but for his ADP, he MUST improve to return value."
Keenan Allen SD (11),16,2.08,165.3,3.1,TIER 3,,TIER 3,"At the end of Week 7, Keenan Allen was the overall WR5. In five of those seven games he had double-digit targets. He was able to be the WR5 despite having only three touchdowns at that point. It all came crashing to a halt the next week as he lacerated his kidney on a TD grab. There's no injury concern for Allen heading into 2016. If the target volume can continue, not a ton of reason to believe it can't, then Allen will be a draft steal. The downside compared to the other top WRs is Allen doesn't provide a ton of big plays, he's reliant on that volume."
T.Y. Hilton IND (10),16,3.06,163,2.67,TIER 3,,TIER 3,"Hilton is the perfect example of a highly productive fantasy player that not very many fantasy players want to roster. Last year was a bit rough, but Andrew Luck was horrible when he played, and was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck when he was injured. Hilton didn't have much of a chance. And still he dropped over 1100 yards and five TDs. He's had three straight seasons of over 1000 yards. It's probably time for the community to show Hilton some fantasy respect. The ceiling is a low level WR1, but there's enough of a sample now to believe in T.Y."
Michael Floyd ARI (9),18,5.04,159.23,4.33,TIER 4,,TIER 4,"Floyd suffered a pretty catastrophic hand injury during training camp where his knuckles reportedly burst through the skin of his hand. I'm not a doctor, but I'd say that's not good for a person that catches a football for a living. He was 'cleared' and ready to play when the season opened, but John Brown was ahead of him on the depth chart. Eventually Floyd caught up to game speed and in the process had 100+ receiving yards in five of his last eight games. Floyd is also in a contract year if that's something you find interesting."
Jeremy Maclin KC (5),19,4.11,155.9,2.17,TIER 4,,TIER 4,"The Dirty Cake that is Jeremy Maclin came into a offense that hadn't seen a single WR score a single TD in over a year. It took until Week 3, but Maclin finally put one on the board. He had a really rough stretch in the middle of the year, but the final six games he Hulked out scoring six of his eight touchdowns. He shouldn't be counted on for putting up top end numbers week to week, but he's a very solid WR2 option."
Eric Decker NYJ (11),20,5.06,151.63,2.33,TIER 4,,TIER 4,"If anyone was able to score a TD during the offseason, it's Eric Decker. The man is a beast of a red zone weapon. For crying out loud, he got it done when Tim Tebow was his quarterback. With Marshall keeping the top pressure off of him, in the 15 games he played, he DIDN'T score in three of them. That's it. Unfortunately this year the secret is out. His ADP is a bit more resepectable this year, but Decker is a solid WR2 target."
Julian Edelman NE (9),21,4.06,154.13,4.43,TIER 4,,TIER 4,"Edelman, like Dez Bryant, suffered a Jones fracture that knocked him out for a good part of the season. He did come back and was highly effective, but has since had another surgery on his foot. The Patriots believe he will be ready sooner than later, but it's a bit of a concern as Edelman's entire game relies on agility and violent planting and cutting. With Tom Brady currently suspended for the first four games of the year, his value could become very attractive knowing he should return to dominance as soon as Brady comes back."
Jordan Matthews PHI (4),22,6.12,151.67,5.63,TIER 4,,TIER 4,"Matthews had high expectations from a lot of fantasy players last season. He did finish as a WR2. He also won the prestigious 'Garbage Man' Footie award from the FootClan. Matthews had a much better 2nd half of the year, similar to his QB Sam Bradford. We have a chicken/egg situation between those two. It could all be for nothing as the Eagles 'took it to the limit' and drafted Carson Wentz. A lot of speculation is floating around if Matthews will continue to man the slot or if he will move outside. The upside exists, the ADP value will likely be there, but the production may not be."
Golden Tate DET (10),26,4.08,147.03,3.17,TIER 4,,TIER 4,"Golden Tate has seen has reception volume spike since moving to Detroit and now Calvin Johnson has announced his retirement. Despite the 90 catches Tate had last year, it was a bit of an anomalous year. He only averaged 9.0 yards per catch, the worst of his career. Until last season, he had never been under 10.8 and he had averaged a little over 14 yards per catch the previous three seasons. Tate seems like a lock for at least 100 receptions and could easily finish the year as a strong WR2."
John Brown ARI (9),23,7.02,148.8,3.83,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"Brown saw his efficiency hit the warp drive in 2015. With two less targets than '14, he improved over 300 receiving yards. It is a bit concerning that nearly 20% of his yards came in Week 6 against the Lions when he dropped 196 against the struggling secondary. Brown is still the third option, but the third option from one of last year's highest producing offenses isn't necessarily a bad thing. Brown is a perfect Flex option."
Kelvin Benjamin CAR (7),24,3.06,147.27,6.33,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"Benjamin went down with an ACL injury before beginning his sophomore season. Very unfortunate considering he was coming off a strong rookie year with over 1000 yards and nine touchdowns. The problem is when Benjamin's production occurred during the games. He scored a high majority of his points in the 4th quarter while the Panthers were trailing. Points are points, but that production can't be sustained. But then 2015 became the year of Cam. Many questions surround Benjamin, was he a product of garbage time, how will he fit in an offense that was so prolific last year, will his injury hamper his play?"
DeSean Jackson WAS (9),25,8.02,145.83,5.4,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"DJax was coming off the best fantasy stretch of his career. Injuries basically destroyed his 2015 season. As of now, drafters are forgetting how effective he was before the injuries, letting him plummet in drafts. Absolutely he's still the boom/bust player, but DJax finds a way to boom more than most. He basically played eight full games, and scored in four of them. Cousins isn't afraid to let it rip down the field to Jackson, he's averaging over 19 yards per catch in his two seasons in Washington. He's shaping up to be a draft day value."
Doug Baldwin SEA (5),27,4.1,144,4.63,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"Doug Freakin Baldwin. In Baldwin's first four years in the league he scored a combined 15 touchdowns. Last year, he dropped 14. 11 of those 14 came in the final six games of the season. It's extremely hard to quantify exactly what happened. In those final weeks Russell Wilson only averaged two more passing attempts more compared to the rest of the season. Drafters seem to be buying into Baldwin, it's hard to blame them but when a player scored 38% of his career TDs in a five week span, all signs point to that being the outlier."
Randall Cobb GB (4),28,4.01,143.3,4.5,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"The table was set for Cobb to have the greatest season of his career. He was coming off a WR1 performance. He was being wooed by the Raiders, but took a smaller deal to stay with Green Bay. Then, Jordy Nelson went down in Preseason. The horn had blown and Cobb needed to elevate his game and become the no.1 receiver on the Packers. (Cue Price is Right failure horn). Cobb was exposed as someone that needs to not be the focal point. The good news is Jordy Nelson is coming back and Cobb's ADP will be down because of the '15 debacle. Just remember, both Cobb and Nelson were WR1's in 2014."
Larry Fitzgerald ARI (9),29,6.03,143.3,2.33,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"Larry had to remind everyone that he's making a push to be a Hall of Fame wide out. But it was a tale of two halves for Fitz. Week 1 through Week 8 he was the overall WR3. Week 9 through Week 17 he was the WR34. It's difficult to know what caused the production drop, defensive adjustments, Michael Floyd returning to health, age. It's also to difficult to gauge which half of the year drafters will be paying attention to. If they let him fall in the draft, don't be afraid to scoop him up."
Allen Hurns JAC (5),30,6.02,140.43,4.83,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"No other WR had the scoring streak that Allen Hurns had. He caught a TD in seven straight weeks. Along with his 10 touchdowns he had over 1000 yards, not bad for a UDFA. He won't be catching anyone off guard this season and his ADP will reflect that. It would be more of a surprise for him to duplicate last year's success, but the big plays will be there. As an auxiliary piece of a starting lineup, he would be great."
DeVante Parker MIA (8),31,7.07,139.53,6.63,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"The highly touted prospect saw his rookie campaign derailed by a foot injury and Rishard Matthews. However, when he finally got his chance he did put up some very solid numbers. He averaged over 74 yards a game over the last six weeks and that includes only one clunker. Parker is the type of player that could easily get the Hype Train rolling and see his ADP skyrocket. If it ends up spiraling out of control, it's likely best to pass on the investment."
Tyler Lockett SEA (5),33,7.06,139.17,4.8,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"The Seahawks traded a lot to move up and grab Lockett. He returned the investment immediately on special teams, becoming the most dynamic kick returner in the league. The first half of the year though, brought little fantasy value as a WR. The second half was a much different story. The first nine games, he had 29 targets. The final 7, he shot up to 40, and his production rose as well. Lockett should be 'locked in' (BOOM) as the second WR in Seattle. If the offense truly runs through Russell Wilson, Lockett can be strong fantasy player."
Jarvis Landry MIA (8),34,4.02,138.5,3.33,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"A true PPR machine last year, Landry was the go to WR in Miami seeing 165 targets come his way. The Dolphins did clear the coaching house over the offseason, so it remains to be seen if Landry will see that volume type again under Adam Gase. However, even with a slight dip Landry is still a very solid option. It's pretty special when a player can have only four TDs and finish as a WR1. He's very likely to return value on his draft price."
Torrey Smith SF (8),34,9.11,139.3,5.97,TIER 5,,TIER 5,"Smith is being left for dead in San Francisco. Things we do know about Smith, he has had a season of over 1000 yards and a season of double-digit scoring. Kelly will be bringing his high volume offense now leading to a bulk increase in snaps. Boldin and Vernon Davis are no longer around. Smith has talent and opportunity to do some damage."
Marvin Jones DET (10),32,9.01,137.1,4.37,TIER 6,,TIER 6,"Jones will be doing his best to replace future HOF member Calvin Johnson. While that's an impossible task, Jones was considered the top FA wide receiver available this year. He has the size and has shown big play ability (who can forget the four touchdown game). Stafford was quietly one of the best fantasy QBs during the second half of the season, AKA as soon as Jim Bob Cooter took over. Jones is an intriguing player this year and going quite late in drafts. He's near the top of the list for late round WR targets."
Emmanuel Sanders DEN (11),36,6.09,137.67,4,TIER 6,,TIER 6,"Sanders saw a hefty dip in his production. This shouldn't come as a huge surprise considering he was coming off a career season and dealt with Manning's underwhelming throws and the inexperienced BO. He still managed over 1000 yards for the second year in a row. Sanders is extremely difficult to forecast coming into 2016. He's the second option on a team with anticipatedly bad QB play, though he dealt with that last year. But it also wouldn't be that surprising to see the Broncos move heavier in their run to pass ratio."
Donte Moncrief IND (10),36,5.08,136,4.17,TIER 6,,TIER 6,"Moncrief started the year hot with touchdowns in five of the first seven games. But the breakout dream died shortly after, along with the Colts' offense. Luck was horrible and injured. Hasselbeck did the best he could while the offensive line let him be destroyed on a weekly basis. Luckily Moncrief is still flying mostly under the radar for fantasy players, but the upside is real. If Luck is going to be a stud for fantasy, Moncrief will absolutely be a part of it."
Willie Snead NO (5),36,10.04,137.33,5.03,TIER 6,,TIER 6,"(Cue The Danger Zone) The Need For Snead ended up as the second best rookie WR for fantasy. It was one of those surprises that shouldn't have been a surprise. Snead finished the year on the cusp of 1000 yards. He looks to be locked as the WR2 for a Drew Brees lead offense. Despite the breakout year, drafters are not paying attention to Snead. The upside is real, and the cost is pennies."
Kevin White CHI (9),39,7.11,129.37,5.7,TIER 6,,TIER 6,"The seventh pick of the 2014 NFL draft lost his entire rookie season to a stress fracture in his shin. Although if you ask John Fox about it, White is likely still probable. The measurables are off the charts for White, 6'3""/215lbs/ran a 4.35 at the combine. He was raw coming into the draft, so he's still raw now with no game experience, but the upside is tremendous. White won't be the first option as long as Alshon is around, but paired with canon-armed Jay Cutler is fantastic. If his price stays around the 8th round, dive in."
Michael Crabtree OAK (10),40,8.06,127.37,3.7,TIER 6,,TIER 6,"Who's laughing now? Crabtree resurrected the the carcass that was his career, and dropped the second best stat line of his career, with the help of Derek Carr and company. Crabtree was the go to possession guy for Oakland last year. The dirty truth from Oakland last year? Crabtree finished as the better fantasy player than Amari Cooper. Looking forward to 2016, it would be no surprise to see Cooper be the man in Oakland, but Crabtree won't be thrown into the trash by the team like he is by fantasy players. He's shaping up like a solid value pick."
Josh Gordon CLE (13),43,6.05,119.4,9.3,TIER 6,,TIER 6,"He's back! Sort of! Eventually! Gordon has been reinstated into the NFL but he's going to have to sit out 4 games. He has been out of the league for a while, and the last time we saw Flash he wasn't really tearing it up. But really, there isn't another WR in the area where Gordon is being drafted that has overall no.1 upside. Big risk, big reward."
Kamar Aiken BAL (8),41,10.07,125,4.33,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"Nobody wants to roster Aiken. Nobody wants to play Aiken. However, if Smith isn't ready to go and Perriman struggles in his unofficial rookie year, Aiken is likely to be the beneficiary. Yes the team signed Mike Wallace, a player on his fourth team in five years, clearly NFL teams love him. Aiken wasn't a dominant force by any stretch, but he was a useful piece for fantasy teams."
Dorial Green-Beckham TEN (13),42,11.02,118.37,5.97,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"There's tough shoes to fill when you get physically compared to Calvin Johnson coming out of college. Especially when you have the misfortune of landing on a team lead by Ken Whisenhunt, who notoriously buries rookies. DGB showed flashes of dominance a few times last season, but nothing enough to give drafters a huge sense of confidence. With the new coaching staff calling for an 'exotic smashmouth' offense, DGB is likely to inconsistent for fantasy and see his ceiling capped."
Vincent Jackson TB (6),44,11.09,119.33,6.47,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"Jackson's season was marred by injury and poor play. The truth is he simply may have hit the wall. His production has dropped the past two years. The positive spin for Jackson is he's still the second option on an evolving offense. Winston showed a solid improvement over the year. He's being left for dead by fantasy players, going extremely late. It's unlikely to see him bounceback to elite form, but it wouldn't be all that surprising to see him have a solid year."
Devin Funchess CAR (7),45,12.06,114.33,5.5,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"When Kelvin Benjamin went down with an ACL in training camp, the immediate Funchess hype grew to legendary proportions. He delivered on the hype only with the exact opposite production. He was an afterthought for much of the season. Moving forward, Funchess paired with Benjamin provides a very unique WR tandem. Neither being overly athletic, but both towering over the average DB. Funchess is simply a flier at this point."
Sterling Shepard NYG (8),46,8.06,117.93,4.67,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"It's a good thing when coming out of college a few people are comparing you to rising superstar Odell Beckham Jr. The weird thing is when the team that already has OBJ drafts you. Despite that, the landing spot for Shepard is about as good as it gets. He will immediately slide into the slot, and the Giants run more three wide receiver sets than any team in the league."
Terrance Williams DAL (7),47,14.1,114.8,4.17,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"Terrence 'TD' Williams had a pretty tremendous opportunity last year with Dez going down for large portion of the year. Unfortunately for him, Romo went down and Williams was left as the no.1 WR for teams lead by Brandon Weeden and Kellen Moore. His total yardage from last year looks ok, until you factor in 21% of it game in the last week of the season. Williams did start 2014 with a flurry of TDs before trailing off. It's unlikely Dallas throws enough to sustain Williams with any consistency."
Stefon Diggs MIN (6),48,9.05,111.23,5.53,TIER 7,,TIER 7,Diggs brought the absolute fire for four weeks. But that fire burned bright and fast. Diggs had 84 targets in the 13 games he played. Nearly 50% of those targets came in those first four games. Teams schemed him out of the game plan for Minnesota. Bringing in Treadwell could certainly open things up for Diggs. We've seen the success but it's possible we've already seen the best that Diggs has to offer.
Markus Wheaton PIT (8),49,9.06,114.8,4,TIER 7,,TIER 7,Some players are jumping all over the late value of Wheaton with Martavis Bryant being suspended the whole year. He will likely slot in as the WR2 on the team with Coates and Heyward-Bey behind him. The problem is Wheaton wasn't effective as a replacement and was actually statistically better in games that Bryant played.
Travis Benjamin SD (11),50,10.01,111.83,5.17,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"Benjamin came storming into the fantasy season with three huge games. Eventually the big plays weren't a weekly lock, but a funny thing happened. He turned into the Browns top WR, in a season the team had just dropped a few briefcases of money in a furnace to acquire Dwayne Bowe. Benjamin was getting double-digit target games, he was having productive games, but the touchdowns all but disappeared. Benjamin earned himself a contract with San Diego and looks to take over the role of the now retired Malcom Floyd. He will boom on occasion, but is unlikely to see enough chances to be a weekly start. A decent flex option as an inconsistent executioner."
Mohamed Sanu ATL (11),50,12.08,110.67,4.83,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"Sanu signed a brand new contract in Atlanta. The fit seems decent, the need was great from Atlanta. But, as far as great fantasy production, it will be hard to expect that from Sanu. In Kyle Shanahan's offense, the second and third WRs on the team simply don't see many targets. In the last three years, non WR1s haven't seen more than 80 targets in the KShy system. Sanu will have solid weeks here and there, but likely a tough player to stash."
Laquon Treadwell MIN (6),52,11.03,105.57,4.5,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"Draft Twitter's no.1 WR from the 2016 class. But ultimately the fourth WR taken in the draft. The landing spot is great and terrible at the same time. Treadwell comes in to a position of being the man. Teddy Bridgewater hasn't shown the ability to sustain any pass catchers as a true fantasy asset. The question can be asked, was this on Teddy or on the rest of the offense. Minnesota must believe it's on the rest of the offense by grabbing Treadwell in the first round. A weekly TD threat, but likely to be inconsistent this year."
Corey Coleman CLE (13),53,9.07,106.87,5.5,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"Many believe the landing spot is questionable. While it may not seem ideal, let us not forget a one Josh Gordon managed to be the best fantasy WR on the Browns, so don't let the past of the team destroy your opinion of Coleman. He's an absolute playmaker, and perhaps the most dominant player from the 2016 draft once the ball is in his hands. Travis Benjamin, the teams top WR from last year is gone, leaving a massive target vacuum. Expect Coleman to step into a very large offensive role starting Week 1."
Kendall Wright TEN (13),55,0.00,102.73,4.3,TIER 7,,TIER 7,"Wright looked like he could be on his way back into the good graces of fantasy players before going down with injury. A decent PPR type safety valve for Mariota, he has the possibility of seeing a decent number of targets. His upside will be capped by a lack of scoring and the 'exotic smashmouth' offense, but he's interesting at the least."
Rishard Matthews TEN (13),54,14.05,106.13,5.3,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Matthews was a pretty big fantasy surprise last year. He managed to keep hyped rookie and first round pick DaVante Parker at bay. Of the 10 full games he played last year, he basically only crapped the bed in two of them. This offseason he was picked up by the Titans. He should automatically become a starter and will see his share of the targets. He's being abandoned on in drafts and could be the savvy pickup from that WR core."
Rueben Randle PHI (4),56,0.00,103.07,5.7,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"ROOBS! Randle is basically a fantasy landmine, the kind once you stand on it you can't move because you know as soon you do he's gonna have an explosive game. This trap is best left alone. If he lures you in again it will be because he's now on the Eagles and the team hasn't seem to found it's WR1. Matthews may or may not simply be a glorified slot WR and Agholor underwhelmed in terrific fashion. The mantra of those that draft Roobs - Abandon all hope 'ye who enter."
Chris Hogan NE (9),57,13.07,95.33,6,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Hogan was given a decent contract from the Pats after the Bills surprisingly decided not to match the free agent offer. Hogan should take over immediately for Brandon Lafell as the WR2 and deep threat. This has been a very productive fantasy role, even for Lafell a few years ago. Hogan is being drastically overlooked and holds some nice late round upside."
Sammie Coates PIT (8),58,11.07,97.03,6,TIER 8,,TIER 8,The sophomore could see a huge jump in playing time with Martavis Bryant getting himself suspended for the year. He's a very athletically gifted player and will be a name to watch over training camp and the preseason. He's being drafted after Markus Wheaton and can very realistically outperform him.
Tavon Austin LA (8),59,11.01,95.17,4.83,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Tavon 'The Gadget' Austin finished the year as a WR2. That's right, a top-24 WR, essentially on the back of four great games. If you played him during any of those weeks, you felt like a genius. He's just so inconsistent and on a low-scoring offense to really be given a serious thought to be on your fantasy roster."
Mike Wallace BAL (8),60,14.03,95.07,7.33,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Wallace now finds himself on his fourth team in five years. He was an interesting signing for the Ravens as his best attributes are the best attributes of Rookie-Sophmore Breshad Perriman. The team was forced into a bad position from injuries last year, and clearly they don't want that to happen again. But Wallace's true role on the offense is still a bit of a mystery."
Ted Ginn CAR (7),61,0.00,95.03,5.3,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Ginn was forced into a much larger offensive role than the Panthers had planned when their WR1 Kelvin Benjamin went down in training camp with a torn ACL.  He responded to the call and was the most productive WR on the team. Before last season, Ginn had scored 11 career receiving touchdowns. He scored 10 in 2015. On only 44 receptions. He's worth a late round flier but he's unlikely to have anywhere near the role he had last year."
Phillip Dorsett IND (10),62,13.05,93.87,5.63,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Dorsett was one of the strangest picks in last year's NFL draft, as he compared to TY Hilton, who was already on the Colts. He spent last year buried on the depth chart and dealing with injury. He has moved up the chart by default with the absence of Andre Johnson. Things also look up with the information the Colts look to move to more three wide receiver sets. The ceiling will be limited for Dorsett as long as Moncrief and Hilton remain healthy."
Pierre Garcon WAS (9),63,14.04,81.23,6.7,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"At this point we know for sure who Garcon is. He will get you around 700-800 yards and 5 or so TDs. At this point, not a guy you really want on your roster considering the absence of upside. Washington spent their first pick on Josh Doctson. Doctson will be a threat to take over for Garcon the entire season, and it won't be a surprise if that happens sooner than later."
Tyler Boyd CIN (9),64,14.02,85.17,6.03,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Boyd, similar to Will Fuller, gets to plug into a solid offense that already has an elite WR option. Cinci has a lot of targets to makeup as they lost Sanu and Marvin Jones this year. Boyd could be a day one starter if he can beat out veteran Brandon Lafell, but it's a long path to see him in a starting fantasy roster anytime soon."
Breshad Perriman BAL (8),65,14.06,62.53,6.97,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Perriman found himself in the mile long list of Baltimore injuries. He looks to establish himself as the no.1 option for the Ravens with Steve Smith coming off of injury as well. Perriman has the physical tools to be a very interesting WR. Extreme speed (a 4.24 at his pro day) combined with Joe Flacco's arm and Marc Trestman's offense could turn into a high yield fantasy situation. We saw Torrey Smith have some very productive seasons in Baltimore, look for Perriman to provide a great late round value."
Steve Smith BAL (8),67,10.06,80.33,8.37,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Smith is simply a beast. Written off again this year, he looked like he would duplicate on his monster 2014 season. The only thing that can stop Smith is catastrophic injury, and that came in the form of a double ruptured achilles tendon. Smith had announced earlier in the year he would be retiring, but Smith decided an injury wouldn't take him out. An achilles injury is extremely difficult to come back from, even in the prime of an athlete's career. Monitor his health status. He could turn into a second half player you want to acquire."
Nelson Agholor PHI (4),67,14.1,77.33,5.7,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Agholor was gifted/cursed with the expectations to produce similar to previous wide receivers in Chip Kelly's offense. Unfortunately, Agholor was not up to the task. Technically Philly's no.1 WR as far as snaps, he would frequently get the oppositions best outside corner. Poor production and injury have left fantasy players abandoning Agholor and not even looking back to see if he's ok. Now in a brand new offense, Agholor's outcome is murky and meh."
Jeff Janis GB (4),67,0.00,69.77,7.37,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Green Bay is a team to watch when it comes to their WR3. Davante Adams was underwhelming in his chances last year, TY Montgomery and Jared Abbrederis each showed a little bit. But none of the backup WRs had a game anywhere close to the game that Janis had in the playoff game against Arizona. The metrics community has always swooned for Janis. But there's something going on that we don't know about, dropping him to the 7th round, keeping him off the field even when it's clear that Adams stinks. Janis is worth the late round flier."
Will Fuller HOU (9),67,14.04,75.67,7.2,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"A pretty cushy landing spot for Fuller. On the Texans he won't have to carry the burden like Coleman or Treadwell right out the gate. He can let Hopkins draw the coverage while Fuller goes to work. The upside for Fuller, the team looks to have gone all in on a higher powered offense bringing in Miller/Osweiler/Fuller. The downside, Fuller has been compared to Ted Ginn...."
Brandon LaFell CIN (9),71,0.00,68,5,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"After a very strong season with the Patriots, there were actually some expectations for Lafell last year. Unfortunately he started the season on unable to play due to injury. When he finally got on the field, things were unpleasant to say the least. The Panthers version of LaFell showed up, and he was shown the door following the end of the season. He's got another opportunity with the Bengals, who have a pretty strong need in the WR area. Speaking for fantasy, it seems unlikely he will have an impact besides a couple touchdowns here and there."
Andrew Hawkins CLE (13),72,0.00,75.83,5,TIER 8,,TIER 8,
Josh Doctson WAS (9),73,14.04,75.97,6,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"A surprise pick for Washington in the draft. The team wasn't considered to be WR needy, so the fact they took Doctson here speaks loudly of their belief in the player. He has a few roadblocks in front of him for this season, namely DJax and Pierre Garcon. However, there is a possibility of one of those veterans being cut before the season, or being sat in favor of the explosive rookie."
Bruce Ellington SF (8),74,14.01,71.83,5,TIER 8,,TIER 8,"Bruce Ellington has had rave reviews in early training camp and is a clear starter for the Chip Kelley offense. With more plays being run per game in a Chip Kelley offense, and the absense of Anquan Bolden, there is an opportunity for some wide receiver to step up and make an impact on fantasy."
Terrelle Pryor CLE (13),66,0.00,81.5,8,TIER 9,,TIER 9,Pryor is an under the radar player who probably won't be drafted in most leagues. But his althetic ability is elite even by NFL standards and his opportunity might be as good as anyone in the league to break out. You could do a lot worse than taking a flier on Pryor at the back of your draft for high upside.

Jaelen Strong HOU (9),75,0.00,55.83,6.5,TIER 9,,TIER 9,Strong flashed a bit towards the end of last season. The flash wasn't enough to stop the Texans from spending their first round pick on a WR as well as taking Braxton Miller in the 3rd. Throw on top of that an offseason arrest for marijuana and Strong could find himself on the bench for a long time.
Jermaine Kearse SEA (5),76,0.00,56.17,3.25,TIER 9,,TIER 9,"Kearse went looking for a contract in free agency, but ended up back with Seattle. The positive: Kearse's numbers have steadily increased each season. The negative: Kearse could see himself behind Tyler Lockett in the pecking order."
Michael Thomas NO (5),77,12.02,71.43,6.7,TIER 9,,TIER 9,"Another rookie that hit the jackpot for a landing spot. When you play WR for the Saints, you have to be just awful at your job to have no fantasy value. Brees is still one of the top QBs in the league, and the Saints offense lets him gun it. Thomas will have to beat out Brandon Coleman to have any kind of real playing time this year, but there's a better chance of that happening than not."
Victor Cruz NYG (8),78,12.09,53.33,8.5,TIER 9,,TIER 9,"Cruz is now a few years removed from his horrifying primetime knee injury. He had said he was going to return last year until a calf injury ended up holding him out for the season. He says he will be ready to go this season, but is still working out on the side of practice. He's an interesting pick if he actually plays, but his return remains to be seen."
Brandon Coleman NO (5),79,0.00,66.5,6.83,TIER 9,,TIER 9,"Coleman gained some buzz as a rookie for the Saints, with Graham leaving town and Colston slowing down. Unfortunately, he was only able to put up 450 yards and two touchdowns. He fell clearly behind Willie Snead. Now Coleman has highly drafted rookie Michael Thomas coming into camp to take his spot. What you can't take away from Coleman is his 6'6"", 225lb frame."
Danny Amendola NE (9),80,0.00,65,6.67,TIER 9,,TIER 9,"The backup to Julian Edelman had a series of very solid games last season. But anyone expecting anything more from Amendola is in for disappointment as that is all he is. Not really worth a roster spot with Edelman healthy, to a must start if Edelman goes down."

Eddie Royal CHI (9),82,0.00,42.83,4.5,TIER 9,,TIER 9,"Things lined up well for Royal last year. A return to the QB that made him fantasy relevant, and an injury to rookie Kevin White oppened up a lot of possible playing time. Royal was unable to do much with the time he had and then dealt with his own injuries. The magic isn't going ot return for Royal."

Davante Adams GB (4),85,14.07,35.5,6,TIER 9,,TIER 9,"To quote Jason Moore, ""He STINKS!"". It's hard to come to any other conclusion after watching Adams last year. To be fair, he wasn't getting true WR1 help from Cobb, and the run game was a disaster with Eddie Lacy. So perhaps he was a victim of circumstance. It won't be surprising to see Green Bay go a different direction with the offense and show Adams to the bench."
