Cam Newton CAR (7),1,3.06,335.3,5.4,TIER 1,,Coming off a career passing year with over 3800 yards and 35 touchdowns. Expecting him to be great for fantasy but those drafting and expecting him to duplicate last year's success could be disappointed. It's a difficult thing to match the best season of your career.
Aaron Rodgers GB (4),1,3.09,339.93,1.5,TIER 1,,"Every full season, besides last year, Rodgers has finished as the QB1 or QB2. It's unlikely he becomes an actual value in regular drafts, but if recency bias poisons your draft and causes him to drop, even this late round QB drafter is going to snatch him up."
Russell Wilson SEA (5),3,5.06,332.8,2.37,TIER 1,,"Has been a fantasy star in multiple ways. Once with his rushing TDs, and last year with high passing efficiency. A safe QB with a very high ceiling despite the lower volume."
Drew Brees NO (5),4,5.11,314.5,2.87,TIER 2,,"The Saints have replenished the weapons for Drew Brees, bringing in Coby Fleener in free agency and Michael Thomas in the draft. Brees still has juice left in the tank and should not be overlooked because of his age."
Andrew Luck IND (10),5,4.12,310.42,4.83,TIER 2,,"No way around it, Luck was awful last year before the kidney incident. With only one full season of elite QB play, investing an early pick in Luck carries risk."
Carson Palmer ARI (9),6,7.05,291.21,3,TIER 3,,"Led the league in YPA last year. Palmer won't be a secret this year, but he's still in a very high powered offense. Look for a season similar to last year, grab if the value is right."
Blake Bortles JAC (5),7,8.01,288.67,6,TIER 3,,"Bortles is definitely on regression alert. He should still be a solid fantasy producer with the weapons around him, but an improved defense could limit Bortles ""garbage time"" opportunities."
Eli Manning NYG (8),8,8.04,283.6,2.63,TIER 4,,"Coughlin is out. McAdoo is in. Eli has a tendency to have absolute stinkers, but is generally solid. The continued emergence of OBJ and the drafting of Sterling Shepard has Eli looking at another solid year."
Ben Roethlisberger PIT (8),9,6.03,282.85,5.3,TIER 4,,"For his career, Big Ben has played 16 games in 3 seasons. 3 out of 12 seasons. Combine his health risk plus only 2 seasons of throwing over 30 TDs, he may not be worth the high pick investment."
Jameis Winston TB (6),9,12.02,282.83,5.07,TIER 4,,The youngest QB to ever throw for over 3000 and 4000 yards. Things really seemed to click in the 2nd half of the year for Winston. Another offseason with Mike Evans and company could see Winston becoming more than a matchup streamer.
Philip Rivers SD (11),11,8.12,281,3.4,TIER 4,,"Old Man Rivers was playing out of his mind with volume last year. He was carrying fantasy teams until Keenan Allen went down. While last year's passer volume shouldn't be expected, the Charger's defense and running could see Rivers passing a ton again this year."
Tyrod Taylor BUF (10),12,10.11,280,7.03,TIER 5,,"Does Buffalo believe in T-Mobile? He wasn't the most consistent fantasy QB, but the threat of his legs and the 2nd half breakout of Sammy Watkins makes Taylor an intriguing fantasy QB for next season."
Ryan Fitzpatrick NYJ (11),13,13.08,275.6,5.7,TIER 5,,"The magic beard is back in New York. The fantasy community rejoiced with much celebration. He was a very capable fantasy QB, and suprisingly consistent. Granted it was basically the best season his career. However, expect the gunslinging to continue and Fitz should be a solid late round QB target."
Andy Dalton CIN (9),14,11.05,272.9,5.17,TIER 5,,"Was making a run at the overall QB1 last year before breaking his thumb. The Bengals have lost some weapons, but still have the elite A.J. Green. Likely to fall pretty far in drafts, despite last year's success and finishing as the QB3 just a few years ago."
Tom Brady NE (9),15,6.1,273.67,4.5,TIER 5,,"#DeflateGate! With Brady now suspended for 4 games, he's going to be an overbearing burden on a small bench. Remember, 4 games is nearly 30% of the regular season for most fantasy leagues. But, if you have a large bench (6 or more) and he falls into double digit rounds, he could become a steal."
Matthew Stafford DET (10),16,11.07,274.74,4.47,TIER 5,,"Remember when Stafford threw for over 5000 yards and was the next big thing in QBs? That was so awesome...5 years ago. To be fair, Stafford has been quietly ok for fantasy players, not great, and now you throw in the loss of Calvin ""Megatron"" Johnson. Some value here, but meh."
Matt Ryan ATL (11),17,12.02,268.44,3.43,TIER 5,,"He was bad last year...wasn't he? Surprisingly right in the zone for attempts and yards, it was the touchdowns that tanked Ryan's fantasy value. He is a candidate to emerge in his 2nd year in the Kyle Shanahan system, but is definitely a drafter beware."
Derek Carr OAK (10),18,9.05,271.68,4.3,TIER 5,,Was surprisingly solid for a stretch of last season. Could be a surprise of the year if Amari Cooper takes the next step and Crabtree continues to return to form.
Marcus Mariota TEN (13),19,13.01,266.33,6.17,TIER 5,,"Was quite efficient last year before the injury, on pace for around 4000 yards. A dynamic playmaker that could find himself buried for fantasy underneath the ""exotic smashmouth"" style of football his ""head coach"" wants to play."
Tony Romo DAL (7),20,10.03,266.71,5.17,TIER 5,,"Always underrated for real football and fantasy. Romo was a league winner in 2014. If his collarbones can hold up, he will yet again provide late round value, but will have some lower scoring weeks during the season."
Kirk Cousins WAS (9),20,10.06,268.97,5.73,TIER 5,,"Will the real Kirk Cousins please stand up? 1st half of the season, ho hum. 2nd half of the season, carrying fantasy players to a title. He seems to ride the wave of his confidence so watch his first few games closely. If he starts hot, get on the train. Faceplants Week 1? Jump off. He's basically the QB version of Groundhog Day."
Colin Kaepernick SF (8),22,0.00,268.33,8,TIER 6,,"Will Kappy be the man? Or will it be Blaine Gabbert? CK is still coming off of surgery but there were whispers from the bushes that new coach Chip Kelly really likes him. He has the tools to run Chip's system to a high level, does he have the mind for it?"
Ryan Tannehill MIA (8),23,14.01,259.17,6.43,TIER 6,,"Oh what could have been with Ryan T?? He actually improved his efficiency and total passing yards, but the big jump never came. On top of that the rushing yards went way down. Adam Gase is coming to town and has coached Peyton and Jay Cutler to some of their best years. It's a longer shot, but it's still possible for Tannehill...maybe...kinda"
Jay Cutler CHI (9),24,14.06,256.5,5.03,TIER 6,,"Smoking Jay Cutty was begrudgingly kept by Chicago due to a wisely crafted contract. This could be Cutty's last ride in Chicago, but surrounded by Alshon and White and a 'Joe Cool' attitude, Cutler has QB2 value."
Joe Flacco BAL (8),25,14.06,243.41,3.73,TIER 6,,"The Ravens led the league in pass attempts in 2015. You did not read that wrong. Likely a product of a bad defense, but Marc Trestman is still there. If any of the WRs can step up, Flacco will have his streaming moments."
Alex Smith KC (5),25,0.00,252.19,2,TIER 6,,"Alex Smith is the epitome of 'if you ain't first, you're last' in fantasy football. Because he either gives you a solid QB1 performance, or he tanks your week. As always, in the right matchup Alex Smith gives your team a chance to win."
Brock Osweiler HOU (9),27,14.06,232.95,6.53,TIER 7,,"New life goals. Do something about 8 times and then get paid $70 million to do it. At least the Texans are going full force to help him succeed. The skill positions are loaded for Houston, young and inexperienced, but loaded. Not great odds, but BO could have fantasy value."
Robert Griffin CLE (13),28,14.06,233.05,7.37,TIER 7,,Can the Masters of Metrics save RG3's career? He's going to be surrounded by young talent and a solid head coach. There is the real chance of turning Coleman into his 2013 Pierre Garcon. Expect Griffin to be a game manager in a run heavy offense.
Blaine Gabbert SF (8),29,0.00,183.57,6.83,TIER 7,,"It is still unclear who will be the starter for the 49ers. Whoever it is will get to enter into the usually productive Chip Kelly offense. The problem here is there is a lack of offensive weapons to throw the ball to. If you want a 49ers QB, you will be able to take one late, but we would recommend bypassing this tandem unless you're in a 2QB league."
Mark Sanchez DEN (11),30,0.00,212.67,8,TIER 7,,
Sam Bradford PHI (4),31,0.00,208.2,8.7,TIER 7,,"From Sammy Biscuits, to Sammy Diapers. If he manages to dry his tears with his guaranteed $22 million dollar contract and go compete, maybe he can keep his starting job. Hot Stat: Bradford has earned $1 million per TD in the NFL..."
Teddy Bridgewater MIN (6),31,14.08,214.33,3.43,TIER 7,,"Teddy Brosevelt. A decent, possibly good, real life QB. A bad, possibly terrible, fantasy QB. The addition of Treadwell is great. But was the basement level passing volume because of the system, or because there was nobody to throw to? A fantasy breakout here seems highly unlikely."
Jared Goff LA (8),33,0.00,174.17,5.83,TIER 7,,"The Rams paid the Iron Price to move up for Goff. It cleary will remain to be seen if that price was worth it in the next few years. But for fantasy football this year, Goff has to near hands off. A rookie QB coming in to play for Jeff Fisher, a coach that hasn't produced a top half offense in almost a decade, won't lead to fantasy points."
Brian Hoyer CHI (9),34,0.00,0.00,0.00,TIER 7,,"Backup for Smoking Jay Cutty! Bad for your health, but good chances you'll get to see the field."
Carson Wentz PHI (4),35,0.00,24.33,7,TIER 7,,
Nick Foles LA (8),36,0.00,0.00,0.00,TIER 7,,One thing comes to mind when the name Nick Foles is mentioned....superstar.
Case Keenum LA (8),36,0.00,15,9,TIER 7,,Got protected by a 1st round option. Got replaced by the 1st overall pick.
Josh McCown CLE (13),38,0.00,0.00,0.00,TIER 7,,"Could still win the job for Cleveland. Was actually a pretty decent fantasy play due to a gunslinger mentality. If Josh Gordon could get on the field with Corey Coleman, McCown is going to let it rip with regularity and could be a fantasy surprise."
Paxton Lynch DEN (11),39,0.00,15,9,TIER 7,,"Paxton Lynch is going to play at sometime this year. It could be far worse for a rookie than getting to start games for the reigning Super Bowl champions. The skill players are there for Paxty to succeed, but he's probably not going to."
Geno Smith NYJ (11),40,0.00,0.00,0.00,TIER 7,,Please no. Just. Please. No.
